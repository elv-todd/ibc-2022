 - talk between App (ELuvio Live) and Wallet
 - message-passing client between parents and children

Elvio Wallet Client -- Integrating the Wallet UI
 - what can you do?  spectrum
   -- no code only data, easiest - just use Eluvio Live - no code required, highly recommended (maskverse, MS)
   -- OR have your own site, no redirecting users away
     -- then two approaches
     -- 1, easiest - drop in an iframe! deep link to specific pagess, etc (control it)
